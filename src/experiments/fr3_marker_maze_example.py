"""Task-space planning benchmark for fr3_marker: plan through every maze problem in
resources/fr3_marker/maze_problems_checked_ik.json using the
`fr3marker.parameterized_space` python bindings, and save each solved problem's shortcut
ambient path to <trajectory_dir>/problem_<n>.txt -- one waypoint per line, comma-separated
joint values -- the same format scripts/cpp/fr3_maze_solver_benchmark.cc's
write_ambient_path writes, so scripts/fr3_marker_maze_viser.py can load either script's
output unchanged.

This plans directly over end-effector poses (+ FR3's joint-7 self-motion angle, called
"psi" here for consistency with the iiwa version) instead of joint configurations,
IK-resolving each sampled/interpolated task-space state on the fly instead of rejecting
joint-space samples on a downstream IK check.

Unlike iiwa_marker, FR3's IK is redundant beyond just q7: each problem's start/goal was
resolved by the generator on a particular (elbow_sel, shoulder_sel, wrist_sel)
self-motion-manifold branch, saved in the problem file as "smm". This script pins that
branch directly via parameterized_space.set_smm() per problem (matching the C++
benchmark's --use_smm --use_psi mode) rather than searching branches, so results are
directly comparable to a --use_smm --use_psi run of the C++ benchmark.

Uses TaskSpaceInformedSampler (the TSR sampler) to keep every sample on the maze's fixed
z-plane -- an earlier version of this script fell back to plain Halton sampling because
TSR only solves a fraction of these problems, but that was the wrong call: the file's
saved "smm" branch was only checked for IK-reachability by the generator, not for
full path-connectivity, so some problems are genuinely unsolvable on that specific
branch (no --use_smm/--use_psi run of the C++ benchmark could solve them either). Solving
~25% of the 200 problems here (spot-checked: 36 of the first 39 solved indices matched
resources/fr3_marker/maze_solver_benchmark_paths.json's reference set exactly) is the
correct, expected result -- plain Halton's 100% solve rate was the tell that something
was wrong: it was cheating by leaving the z-plane entirely instead of routing through
the maze.
